# Personalized Study Planner

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Student Study Planner Application,  
which will serve as a digital tool to help students organize and manage their academic responsibilities efficiently.  
The application addresses the problem of poor time management,  
missed deadlines, and exam stress by providing a centralized platform for study planning,  
task management, and exam preparation.   

## Technology Stack
- **Java**
- **JavaFX** for GUI
- **MariaDb** for database management
- **JDBC** for database connectivity
- **JUnit** for testing
- **Maven** for project management and build automation
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment

## Otp_2 Course:

## Added Features in Otp_2: Internationalization of application (Localization), and testing of the new features.

In this course (Otp_2) we will add to our already existing application the following features, the localization or internationalization of the application,
to support multiple languages. These features will be added during the course in 4 different sprints to further enhance the project for a wider spectrum 
of languages so that the user base expands.

### Key Features:

*   **Multi-Language Support:** The entire graphical user interface (GUI) has been localized and is available in the following languages:
    *   English (Default)
    *   Finnish
    *   Persian
    *   Chinese
*   **Dynamic Language Switching:** Users can switch the applications language on-the-login page from a menu available on login page, 
providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
*   **Database is used for localization:** The localization is implemented using database, which makes it more convenient to add new 
languages or modify existing translations without changing the applications source code.

This feature will significantly enhance the project and demonstrate a robust architecture that can be ready for further
localization or for further expansion of the application.

In addition we will also make more test files to test the correctness of the localizations during this course.
